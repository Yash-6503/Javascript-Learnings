//Variables in Javascript
//Variables are containers for storing data values.
//In this example, x, y, and z are variables:
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
console.log(z);

//Variables are declared with the let keyword as well as const.
//A constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed once it is assigned.

const accountId = 123456;
let accountName = "John Doe";
accountBalance = 1000.00;
let accountCity = "Nashik";

// accountId = 98765;       Constant Variables value cannot change once it is declared.
accountName = "John Smith";
accountBalance = 2000.00;
accountCity = "Pune";

console.log(accountId);
console.log(accountName);
console.log(accountBalance);
console.log(accountCity);
console.table[accountId, accountName, accountBalance, accountCity];
