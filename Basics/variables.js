//Variables in Javascript
//Variables are containers for storing data values.
//In this example, x, y, and z are variables:
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
console.log(z);

//Variables are declared with the var keyword as well as let and const.

const accountId = 123456;
let accountName = "John Doe";
accountBalance = 1000.00;
let accoutCity = "Nashik";

console.table[accountId, accountName, accountBalance, accoutCity];
